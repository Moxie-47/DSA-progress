## ✅ Problems Solved

### - [Minesweeped](../../Topic-wise/Graph/Minesweeped.cpp)
- **Approach**: Used **BFS** with a queue.
- **Learning**: Initially got stuck by not using a direction array for `(x, y)` movement.
- **Complexity**:
  - **Time**: O(n * m), where `n = rows` and `m = columns`
  - **Space**: O(n * m)

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Revisited BFS traversal for grid-based problems.
- Importance of direction arrays to simplify code and avoid bugs.

## ⏱ Time Spent
- ~1.15 minutes
