## ‚úÖ Problems Solved

### - [Minesweeped](../../Topic-wise/Graph/Minesweeped.cpp)
- **Approach**: Used **BFS** with a queue.
- **Learning**: Initially got stuck by not using a direction array for `(x, y)` movement.
- **Complexity**:
  - **Time**: O(n * m), where `n = rows` and `m = columns`
  - **Space**: O(n * m)

## üß† Key Takeaways
- Revisited BFS traversal for grid-based problems.
- Importance of direction arrays to simplify code and avoid bugs.

## ‚è± Time Spent
- ~1.15 minutes

### - [Max area of Island](../../Topic-wise/Graph/Max-Area-of-island.cpp)
- **Approach**: Used **DFS** with a recursion.
- **Learning**: Same as of Minesweeped.
- **Complexity**:
  - **Time**: O(n * m), where `n = rows` and `m = columns`
  - **Space**: O(n * m)

## üß† Key Takeaways
- Questions changes but the core concept remain same

## ‚è± Time Spent
- ~14 minutes

### - [Max num of fish](../../Topic-wise/Graph/Max-num-of-fish.cpp)
- **Approach**: Used **DFS** with a recursion.
- **Learning**: Same as of Max area of Island.
- **Complexity**:
  - **Time**: O(n * m), where `n = rows` and `m = columns`
  - **Space**: O(n * m)

## üß† Key Takeaways
- Questions changes but the core concept remain same

## ‚è± Time Spent
- ~5 minutes
