- **Minesweeped**: used bfs approach implemented using queue. Was quite easy but still got stuck as forgot to think about using the direction array for x & y.

  - **[Code](./Minesweeped.cpp)**  
  - **Time Complexity**: `O(n*m)`  , n = rows & m = colms
  - **Space Complexity**: `O(n*m)`


- **Max-Area-of-island**: used dfs approach using recursion. Also used the direction array. Quite easy

  - **[Code](./Max-Area-of-island.cpp)**  
  - **Time Complexity**: `O(n*m)`  , n = rows & m = colms
  - **Space Complexity**: `O(n*m)`
